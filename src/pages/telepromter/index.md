Hey, I’m Sergey. I’ve been busy in software engineering for over 20 years, working on everything from AI-driven systems to large-scale cloud platforms. Most recently I was one of the first engineers at Regie.ai, where I helped build and scale their AI-native sales enablement platform.

Over the years, I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies — Node.js, TypeScript, React, Golang, AWS - you name it. I like solving tricky problems especially around performance and scalability, and I really enjoy building things that people actually use.

Along the way, I’ve led teams, modernized legacy systems, and built tools relied on by Fortune 500 companies. Earlier, I even built a binary-level cross-compiler and helped evolve Spirent Velocity - a lab automation platform that powers 5G network delivery accross Europe with partners like Nokia.

Excited to connect, share ideas, and work on cool projects together.

Thank you for watching, and have a great day!
