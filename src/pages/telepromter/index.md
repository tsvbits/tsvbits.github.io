Hey, I’m Sergey. I’ve been in software engineering for over 20 years, working on everything from AI systems to big cloud platforms. Most recently I was one of the first engineers at Regie.ai, where I helped build and scale their AI-native sales enablement platform.

I’ve touched a lot of different tech — Node.js, TypeScript, React, Golang, AWS — you name it. I like solving tricky problems around performance and scalability, and I really enjoy building things that people actually use. Along the way, I’ve led teams, modernized legacy systems, and built products that Fortune 500 companies rely on.

Excited to meet new people, share ideas, and work on cool projects together.

Thank you for watching this video and have a nice day.
