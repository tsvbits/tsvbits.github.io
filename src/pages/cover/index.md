Hey,

> __TL;DR__ 20 years of experience as full-stack engineer. Areas of expertise: Architecture, Web and API development, .NET, C#, SQL, Web API, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, Git, Agile. I don't afraid to learn and try new things and make crazy stuff like [a cross compiler](https://github.com/grapecity/pagefx)

I am SergeyT. I am software engineer with 20 years of professional experience making world better by writing useful computer programs. Usually I play full-stack roles. I've been programming with passion for half of my life. I solved a ton of puzzles and fixed no end of bugs. And I am still writing code almost every day.

I love working on complex projects with positive and smart people around me. I've been involved in challenging projects ranging from
* [hardware abstraction layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCEM6Z3KvU0&list=PLQR99hR6kJODS8Nehz1PkfvNYTlFJR9fj&index=2)
* [cross-compilers](https://github.com/GrapeCity/pagefx)
* [report generators](https://www.grapecity.com/activereports)
* [distributed systems](https://www.spirent.com/products/lab-as-a-service-automation-velocity)

I tend to solve problems pragmatically and proactively. And also I care about:
* finding efficient and simple solutions.
* making friendly interfaces that are [easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly](https://www.aristeia.com/Papers/IEEE_Software_JulAug_2004_revised.htm).

I’m just keep doing and doing it with calm and passion, usually having fun :)

Thanks,\
Sergey
