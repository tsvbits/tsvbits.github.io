Hey there! I am Sergey Todyshev. I am software engineer with over 15 years of professional experience making software products for humans. Usually I play full-stack roles. You can [email me](mailto:stodyshev@gmail.com) to get [technical support](/support) or maybe even hire me.

## I can do

- pretty complex huge web apps like [Velocity](/velocity)
- complex distributed systems like [Velocity](/velocity)
- complex report generators like [ActiveReports](/activereports)
- HTML to PDF generators like [CarbonDocs](https://carbondocs.windows10compatible.com/)
- low level cross compilers like [PageFX](/pagefx)
- tomography analysis software like [voXcat](/voxcat) for [DiOptic](https://www.dioptic.de)
- [interferometry software](/interferometry)
- LabView like visual programming system
- hardware abstraction layers like [Device Manager](/devicemanager) for [IAE](/iae)

in short both application-level and system-level programming with any kind of complexity
