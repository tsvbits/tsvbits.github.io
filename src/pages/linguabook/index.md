I am building [a micro app](https://linguabook.github.io/) for learning [Ogden's Basic English](http://basic-english.org/).
It is open source project with code available on [github](https://github.com/linguabook/linguabook.github.io).

Under the hood it is heavily using my [Just-in-Time scraper](https://github.com/lingvograph/scraper) (my another open source project). This scrapper parses HTML pages from multiple sources in the browser and the parsed results are displayed on the page.

Here are some ideas for making the app even better:
* infinite feed with all words displayed as instagram-like cards
* ignoring known words
* wrapping it into mobile app using React Native or [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/)
* multi-language support
* adding more word lists for advanced users

Enjoy! EOF :smile:
