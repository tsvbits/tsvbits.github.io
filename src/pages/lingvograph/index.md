It is supposed to be a replacement of [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).
WordNet can be absorbed by LingvoGraph.
It can also absorb all other language dictionaries.
It can be pretended to be a universal language database.
You can find more info in [this landing page](/https://lingvograph.netlify.app/) too.
It is mainly built by programmers being just graduated or  and me :)

## Features

- Nice mobile app looks like instagram with the focus on helping with language learning
- It is a store of visual associations between language elements
- It is a store of multiple audio recordings per word, phrase

## Status

- Most parts are implemented by [NSU](https://www.nsu.ru/) students and me :)
- Incomplete, but many parts are in pretty good shape

## Tools

It is used pretty modern tech:

- [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
