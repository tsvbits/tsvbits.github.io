It was intended to allow building multi-platform internet applications using C# and the Adobe Flash Player VM. The project was pivoted for internal use at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Dynamics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Data Dynamics</a> after the release of Microsoft Silverlight.</p>\n<p>I joined this project in June of 2007. My first experience with this technology was an attempt to build a real-world applications on the initial prototypes, which were unsuccessful. We decided to rewrite the compiler based on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">.NET CLI ECMA-335 spec</a> - this doc describes format of .NET executable files</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/avm2overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AVM overview doc</a> - this doc describes format of byte code parsed and executed by ActionScript Virtual Machine</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adobe/avmplus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AVM source code</a> - initial version was hosted at <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-central\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mozilla</a></li>\n<li>also I’ve showed CIL, SWF, ABC readers I’ve done so far as artifact of my learning CIL and ABC executable file formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I made few major iterations to make the compiler.\nFirst iteration was not successful though a lot of test cases worked. I’ve tried to build .NET decompiler first and then translate it to AVM bytecode.\nI don’t remember why I’ve decided to deny approach with decompiler, but idea with binary translation won and I’ve quickly implemented first prototype.</p>\n<p>Then it took about 6 months to get working a lot of <a href=\"https://www.mono-project.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mono</a> tests for bytecode generated by C# 2.0 CLR 1.0 format (basically no generics).</p>\n<p>With the availability of more resources the following were added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost full support of CLR 2.0 byte code format including generics</li>\n<li>Interop with libraries built by ActionScript compiler (ASC)</li>\n<li>Debugger for Visual Studio 2008</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project was successfully used to build our multi-platform report viewer as part of the ActiveReports Server platform and ActiveReports product lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-open-source\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#going-open-source\" aria-label=\"going open source permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Going open source</h2>\n<p>This project might be interesting for education purposes for Microsoft Research students or any other universities.</p>\n<p>I’ve made an experimental branch with additional changes that were not used in production:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PFX compiler to be cross-platform/runnable on Mono VM and compatible with Mono C# compiler</li>\n<li>Reuse of Mono MDB reader, i.e. managed reader of debug symbols.
